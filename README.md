# emp_payroll_classes

This program asks an employee for their 
name, their hours worked, and their hourly rate.  It calculates the gross pay (wages)
for the employee by multiplying the hours worked and hourly rate.  Finally it outputs
a short payroll report to a file with the employees name, hours worked, hourly rate, and total wages.
